        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Eren Yeager is the main protagonist of the anime and manga "Attack on Titan." He starts as a young boy who witnesses the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother, which fuels his rage and shapes his destiny. His journey begins with a pure desire for revenge but evolves into a deep ideological struggle revolving around freedom, justice, and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>What truly defines Eren is his internal evolution: from impulsive anger to calculated long-term planning, from a hopeful hero to a controversial figure whose decisions blur the lines between right and wrong. As the Attack Titan, his powers grant him immense strength but also burden him with heavy consequences affecting everyone around him.</p>
        <p>On a personal level, Eren can be seen as a tragic figure — a person with a vision of freedom but a path filled with painful choices, raising questions about whether the ends justify the means.</p>
